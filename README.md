# JavaBuzz!

## Welcome to FizzBuzz with a Javascript twist... JAVABUZZ!

To have a crack at playing this very original game:
1. Download this repo to your machine
2. In the javabuzz directory, enter 'open SpecRunner.html'
3. This will open your browser with all Jasmine tests passing
4. To play, you must be in a browser where code can be inspected
  e.g. Google Chrome. 
5. Inspect the SpecRunner.html page
6. Navigate to console
7. Instantiate a new Javabuzz class 'var javabuzz = new Javabuzz();'
8. Start using the .says method: 'javabuzz.says(3)' => Java

## Credit where its due
This is my first week of Javascript, so this programme is part of 
a Makers exercise.  I have used their guidance when I was stuck on 
creating tests, passing them and using Jasmine.
